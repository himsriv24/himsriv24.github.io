I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/neurological/research), where I work on neurotechnology and brain signal processing for epilepsy research. My current work focuses on seizure segmentation in stereotactic EEG (sEEG) and unsupervised learning of ictal patterns using contrastive latent representations.

I received my Ph.D. from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in the Department of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering, advised by [Prof. S. Ramakrishnan](https://biomedical.iitm.ac.in/faculty/ramakrishnan/) and [Dr. Subha D. Puthankattil](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=9bDlvCsAAAAJ). My doctoral research centered on the analysis and classification of audio-visual stimuli induced emotional states using EEG signals, leveraging advanced signal processing and explainable machine learning techniques.

Prior to Cleveland Clinic, I was a Guest Scientist at [University Hospital RWTH Aachen](https://www.ukaachen.de/en/) (Germany) through the prestigious DAAD Bi-National Guided Research Fellowship, where I investigated EEG-based impulsivity classification and functional brain network analysis. I hold an Integrated M.Tech in Biomedical Engineering from [IIIT Allahabad](https://www.iiita.ac.in/), where I graduated with a Bronze Medal for academic excellence.

My research interests span neurotechnology, brain-machine interfaces, biomedical signal processing, EEG/sEEG analysis, affective computing, cognitive neuroscience, and explainable AI. I am a peer reviewer for journals including *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing*, *Brain Communications*, *Journal of Neural Engineering*, and *Scientific Reports*.
