I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Epilepsy Center, Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/neurological/depts/epilepsy), working with [Dr. Balu Krishnan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e9PG7noAAAAJ&hl=en) on neurotechnology and brain signal processing for epilepsy research. My current work focuses on seizure segmentation in stereotactic EEG (sEEG) and unsupervised learning of ictal patterns using contrastive latent representations.

I received my Ph.D. from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in the Department of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering, advised by [Prof. Ramakrishnan Swaminathan](https://apm.iitm.ac.in/pages/profile-ramakrishnans) and [Dr. Subha D. Puthankattil](https://nitc.ac.in/department/electrical-engineering/faculty-and-staff/faculty/2c0ca691-95db-4e0c-ab16-bc23c6835e85). My doctoral research centered on the analysis and classification of audio-visual stimuli induced emotional states using EEG signals, leveraging advanced signal processing and explainable machine learning techniques.

Prior to Cleveland Clinic, I was a Guest Scientist at [University Hospital RWTH Aachen](https://www.ukaachen.de/en/) (Germany) through the prestigious DAAD Bi-National Guided Research Fellowship, supervised by [Prof. Ute Habel](https://www.psychiatrie.ukaachen.de/en/univ-prof-dr-rer-soc-ute-habel/), where I investigated EEG-based impulsivity classification and functional brain network analysis. I hold an Integrated M.Tech in Biomedical Engineering from [IIIT Allahabad](https://www.iiita.ac.in/), where I graduated with a Bronze Medal for academic excellence.

My research interests span neurotechnology, brain-machine interfaces, biomedical signal processing, EEG/sEEG analysis, affective computing, cognitive neuroscience, and explainable AI. I am a peer reviewer for journals including *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing*, *Brain Communications*, *Journal of Neural Engineering*, and *Scientific Reports*.
